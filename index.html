<h3>My experience from my trip in Holland</h3>

<p>One thing that became clear to me on that trip was that travel was making me strong and independent. It was showing me the person I could be and how compendent I was.</p>

<p>Travel showed me my strengths and more importantly, what I deserved. Travel became and still is an integral part of my life.</p>
